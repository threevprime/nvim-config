# Threev's Neovim Config

This is my neovim config. Feel free to clone it and use it for your own.

I've used [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) for this configuration.

It is simplistic and has all the tools I need for myself and even use.

More updates will be made along the way based on what kinda cool stuff I start doing.

If you already have a config installed I recommend you run ``rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`` and ``rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim/``.
This will make sure there are not gonna be any issues with old config files.
